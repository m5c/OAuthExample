# OAuth2 Sample Configuration

A minimal OAuth2 sample, to illustrate standard roles and communciation for resource access authorization.

## About

The OAuth2 protocol is an industrial standard to allow access of REST resources through a third party service, on behalf of their owner. The purpose is to strip the need for credential sharing, by means of impersonation via cryptographic tokens.
The key entities in any OAuth2 interplay are three RESTful services:

 * A **Resource Server**: It offers a resource, belonging by a *Resource Owner*. The latter is usually a biological or legal person.
 * A **Client**: It needs to access a protected resource of the *Resource Server*, on behalf of the *Resource Owner*.
 * An **Authorization Server**: It is the center part of the OAuth2 protocol and provides secure tokens that allow impersonation of the *Resource Owner* by the *Proxy Service*, without credential sharing.  
 > Note that depending on the protocol variant, the **Authorization Server** may be replaced by an existing entitiy e.g. an Authorization server provider by Google, Spotify, etc...*

This repository hosts sample implementations of the three services, that allow a play-though of the protocol. There is no implementation of the **Rersource Owner**, which is the human player in the OAuth2 dance.

## Services

This repository reflects the [standard protocol entities](#about) as follows:

 * A [modified version](ResourceServer) of the TimeService as **Resource Server**: Sample users (resource owners) have their proper time resource, which upon access tells the time in their customized format.
 * A newly coded [Time Proxy Service](Client) as OAuth2 **Client**, which attempts to access the TimeService on behalf of the user and therefore needs to be delegated permission, using the OAuth2 Protocol.
 * An (almost) off-the-shelf [Authorization Service](AuthorizationServer) which keeps track of users, services, granted access and tokens, to allow for a secured resource access following the OAuth2 dance. 

## Communication Layout

The effective OAuth2 communication layout varries, depending on how roles are sperated or fused:

 * In essence, these variants differ in *how the granted authorization* is transferred back from Authorization Server to Client.
 * The above process of transferring the authorization is called [**Authorization Grant Type**]() in protocol jargon.
 * Here we only deal with the standard case where parties place minimal trust in one another, and are fully separated.  
 * This **Type** is called [**Authorization Code**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.1), in protocol jargon.

Below schema illustrates the communication flow for the standard **Authorization Code** variant:

```
     +--------+                               +---------------+
     |        |--(A)- Authorization Request ->|   Resource    |
     |        |     (is a redirect to AS)     |     Owner     |
     |        |<------------------------------|               |
     |        | (B.3) RO forwards Auth. Code) +---------------+
     |        |                                  ^   ^
     |        |            (B.1) Page Forward    |   |  (B.2) RO grants auth.
     |        |             & grant form reply   v   v   & AS returns Auth. Code
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |--(C)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
     | Client |                               |     Server    |
     |        |<-(D)----- Access Token -------|               |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |
     |        |                               +---------------+
     |        |--(E)----- Access Token ------>|    Resource   |
     |        |                               |     Server    |
     |        |<-(F)--- Protected Resource ---|               |
     +--------+                               +---------------+
```

 > Note: The above layout is based on the official protocol specifiation. Additional arrows were added to better illustrate the *Request Reply* nature of the underlying HTTP protocol. Steps ```B.1-B.3``` reflect the **Authorization Code** communcation layout.
